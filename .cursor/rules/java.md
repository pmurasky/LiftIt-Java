# Java Standards

When working with Java files, follow the conventions in `engineering-standards/docs/JAVA_STANDARDS.md`.
Read that file for Java-specific guidance on modern Java 21 features, null safety,
immutability, dependency injection, streams, testing with JUnit 5, and more.
For design patterns, also reference `engineering-standards/docs/DESIGN_PATTERNS.md`.
For SOLID principles with Java-specific examples, see `engineering-standards/docs/SOLID_PRINCIPLES.md`.
