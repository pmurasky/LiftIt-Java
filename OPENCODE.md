# OpenCode Guidance

This file is a lightweight entrypoint for OpenCode usage in this repository.

## Canonical Standards

Follow these sources in order and do not duplicate or override them here:

1. `AGENTS.md`
2. `CLAUDE.md`
3. `engineering-standards/docs/AI_AGENT_WORKFLOW.md`
4. `engineering-standards/docs/PRE_COMMIT_CHECKLIST.md`
5. Other relevant files in `engineering-standards/docs/`

## Working Conventions

- Keep changes focused and small (micro-commit friendly).
- Run required validation before commits (tests, build, lint/static analysis as applicable).
- Use clear file references in updates (for example: `src/main/java/...`).
- Prefer concise progress updates and explicit next steps.

## Scope

This document intentionally stays short to prevent rule drift.
If guidance here conflicts with canonical standards, canonical standards win.
